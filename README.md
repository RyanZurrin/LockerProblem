# LockerProblem

N lockers numbered 1 to N with N students lined up in front of lockers 
starting at locker 1. The first student opens all the lockers. The second
student closes every second locker. The third student toggles every third
locker. The fourth student toggles every fourth locker. That same pattern
continues for all N students and N lockers.

## Hereâ€™s the problem to be solved:  
What is the state of the lockers after all N students have completed their
pass through the lockers?
